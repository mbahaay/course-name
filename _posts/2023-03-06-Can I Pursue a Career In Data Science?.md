## Introduction

This blog post is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

In today's digital era, data is more accessible than ever before. Recent advancements in technology have enabled data science to become an increasingly important field in our lives. It can help organizations make better decisions and identify new revenue opportunities.

Data science is a rapidly growing field that is in high demand. Many professionals are seeking to pursue a career in data science and wondering if this could be a good career choice for the future.

In this project, we'll utilize a dataset for different data science-related jobs to draw insights that would help us answer the following questions:

- What are the most in-demand data science-related jobs?
- Do data science jobs require a high level of experience?
- How do salaries compare to the level of experience?
- Are there more job opportunities at large or small companies?
- Are data science jobs suitable for working remotely?
- 
## The Dataset

The dataset contains 245 records of anonymous salary information for various data science related jobs during 2020/21. It has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/data-science-jobs-salaries) and was originally collected by [ai-jobs.net](https://salaries.ai-jobs.net/).

### Question1: What are the most in-demand data science related jobs?

Below are the top 10 most in-demand jobs related to the data science field as inferred from the count of employments that took place during the period of the study; they represent 60% of the total number of employments covered by the study.

It can be observed that the majority of data science jobs (73.4%) required a relatively high level of experience (intermediate or expert level), however, it is still applicable for juniors where around 22% of employment was for entry-level jobs.

### Question3: How do salaries compare to the level of experience?

The average annual salary is ~100K USD. However, the salaries for these roles can vary significantly depending on the level of experience. An entry-level position would start at an average of ~60K USD, while a senior position can earn more than double this.

### Question4: Are there more job opportunities at large or small companies?

Job opportunities are more likely in the large companies where more than half the employment took place.

### Question5: Are data science jobs suitable for working remotely?
